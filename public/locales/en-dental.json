            {
                "question": "What is gastric sleeve surgery?",
                "answer": "Gastric sleeve surgery, also known as sleeve gastrectomy, is a bariatric procedure that removes approximately 80% of the stomach, leaving a banana-shaped sleeve. This reduces stomach capacity and decreases hunger hormones, leading to significant weight loss."
            },
            {
                "question": "Am I a good candidate for gastric sleeve?",
                "answer": "Ideal candidates have a BMI of 35 or higher, have tried other weight loss methods without success, and are committed to making lifestyle changes. A detailed consultation and health assessment will determine if gastric sleeve is suitable for you."
            },
            {
                "question": "How long does the gastric sleeve surgery take?",
                "answer": "Gastric sleeve surgery usually takes between 1 to 2 hours and is performed laparoscopically through small incisions, resulting in minimal scarring and faster recovery."
            },
            {
                "question": "How long is the recovery period?",
                "answer": "Most patients stay in the hospital for 2-3 days and can return to work within 2-3 weeks. Full recovery and adaptation to new eating habits typically takes 4-6 weeks."
            },
            {
                "question": "How much weight can I expect to lose?",
                "answer": "Most patients lose 60-70% of their excess weight within the first year after surgery. Results vary based on individual commitment to diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes."
            },
            {
                "question": "Will I need to follow a special diet after surgery?",
                "answer": "Yes, you'll follow a progressive diet starting with liquids, then pureed foods, soft foods, and eventually solid foods. Our nutritionist will provide a comprehensive diet plan and ongoing support to ensure your success."
